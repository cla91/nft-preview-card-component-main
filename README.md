## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make an overlay. At first I tried to use only the background property, but it simply didn't work out, I mean the svg for the effect blended with the background so it wasn't the result I desired.
